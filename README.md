# synchronized

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tekartik/synchronized.dart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tekartik/synchronized.dart)

Basic lock mechanism to prevent concurrent access to asynchronous code

## Goal

You were missing hard to debug deadlocks, here it is! 

The goal is to propose a solution similar to critical sections and offer a simple `synchronized` API Ã  la Java style.
It provides a basic Lock/Mutex solution to allow features like transactions.

The name is biased as we are single threaded in Dart. However since we write asychronous code (await) like we would
write synchronous code, it makes the overall API feel the same.

The goal is to ensure for a single process (single isolate) that some asynchronous operations can run
without conflict. It won't solve cross-process (or cross-isolate) synchronization.

For single process (single isolate) accessing some resources (database..), it can help to
 * Provide transaction on database system that don't have transaction mechanism (mongodbn, file system)
 * In html application make sure some asynchronous UI operation are not conflicting (login, transition)

## Feature

 * Synchronized block are reentrant
 * Timeout support
 * Consistent behavior (i.e. if it is unlocked calling synchronized grab the lock)
 * Work on Browser and DartVM
 * No dependencies (other than the sdk itself)
 
It differs from the `pool` package used with a resource count of 1 by being reentrant

## Usage

A simple usage example:

    import 'package:synchronized/synchronized.dart';

    main() {
      var lock = new Object();
      synchronized(lock, () async {
        // Only this block can run (once) until done 
        ...
      });
    }
    
Any object can become a locker, so in a class method you can use

    synchronized(this, () async {
      // do some stuff
    });

A SynchronizedLock object has a locked helper method

    var lock = new SynchronizedLock();
    if (!lock.locked) {
      lock.synchronized(() async {
        // do some stuff
      });
    }
    
The return value is preserved

    int value = await synchronized(this, () {
      return 1;
    });
    
## How it works

It uses `Zone` to know in which context a block is running in order to be reentrant.
It maintains a list of active locks and tasks to run them consecutively

## Example

Consider the following dummy code

    Future writeSlow(int value) async {
      new Future.delayed(new Duration(milliseconds: 1));
      stdout.write(value);
    }
    
    Future write(List<int> values) async {
      for (int value in values) {
        await writeSlow(value);
      }
    }
    
    Future write1234() async {
      await write([1, 2, 3, 4]);
    }

Doing 

    write1234();
    write1234();
    
would print

    11223344
    
while doing

    synchronized(this, write1234);
    synchronized(this, write1234);

would print

    12341234
